# Node.js practice
### This is set of practical tasks and pet projects I made while completing the course "Nodejs: The complete guide to build RESTful APIs (2018)" on Udemy by Mosh Hamedani
#### The main pet project is Vidly application which is a MongoDB database and fully working API connected together
### Tech stack for Vidly app:
#### Main
- **NodeJS**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**
- **lodash** (for better managing arrays and objects)
- **Fawn** (for creating a sequence of operations to make complex request to a db)
- **mongoose** (for working with mongodb using express)

#### Validating data
- **Joi** (for better validating data)
- **joi-password-complexity** (for better validating and securing user passwords)

#### Logging and error handing
- **winston** (for logging info and error in file)
- **winston-mongodb** (for logging info and error in a separate collection in MongoDB)
- **express-async-errors** (for catching promises error and such)

#### Security
- **config** (for managing environmetal variables depending on the environment)
- **jsonwebtoken** (for managing jsonwebtokens in the app)
